# Regression Metrics

-> This project explores the key **evaluation metrics** used in regression models to measure prediction accuracy and model performance.


## Objective:-
->To understand, calculate, and compare various regression metrics like **MAE**, **MSE**, **RMSE**, and **R² Score** both manually and using sklearn.


## Key Concepts:-
-> Importance of evaluating regression models  
-> Mathematical intuition behind error-based metrics  
-> How to choose the right metric for your task  


## Metrics Covered:-

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

-> Represents average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

-> Penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE.

### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

-> Provides error in the same unit as the target variable.

### R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

-> Measures how well the regression line fits the data (closer to 1 = better fit).


## Libraries Used:-

-> numpy
-> pandas 
-> mean_absolute_error
-> mean_squared_error
-> r2_score
-> matplotlib
-> seaborn
